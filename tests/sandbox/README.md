## Tests for the toy sandbox protocol

To develop Feditest, we created a toy "sandbox" protocol that's extremely light-weight. It runs entirely in-memory and does not require external servers. This directory contains tests for that toy sandbox protocol. They serve no purpose other than for certain aspects of feditest development itself.
