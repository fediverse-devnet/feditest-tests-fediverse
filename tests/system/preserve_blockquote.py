I believe HTML support (or at least acknowledgement) is either spec or long-established de-facto standard, so yes it should be checked. Nothing should be deployed to the modern Fediverse without the distinction of block and inline elements, even if, say, it has no idea what bold is or what is.

If you can get a post's Markdown source, showing that is suboptimal but acceptable in early development -- you want to make sure it's accessible before a full release though, and plain text Markdown isn't exactly accessible.
